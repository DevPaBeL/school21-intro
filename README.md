# School21-intro
At this stage, I was going through the pool of School 21, day after day I completed various projects proposed for quests, the complexity of the execution grew every day, but I am glad that in such short deadlines for each project, I was able to learn the C language, as well as teamwork.
Projects from the easiest to the most difficult will be added below in table:
| Project  | Date |
|-|-|
| T01D03  | 1 week at the pool, day 3; (working with the C language);  |
| T01D04  | 1 week at the pool, day 4; (working with the C language);  |
