# School21-intro
At this stage, I was going through the pool of School 21, day after day I completed various projects proposed for quests, the complexity of the execution grew every day, but I am glad that in such short deadlines for each project, I was able to learn the C language, as well as teamwork.
Projects from the easiest to the most difficult will be added below in table:
